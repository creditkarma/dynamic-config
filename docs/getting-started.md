# Getting Started

As mentioned, Dynamic Config can adapt to a number of different situations, but I think it's important to go through setting up a simple working application. Most use-cases will not require more than this.

We're just going to standup an express server with one route that returns a string, but we are going to configure this application for a number of different environments.

## Make a New Project

```sh
$ mkdir config-example
$ cd config-example
$ npm init
```

I'm also going to be using TypeScript, so we need to set that up.

### TSCONFIG

My `tsconfig.json` looks like this:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es6",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "rootDir": "./src",
        "outDir": "./dist",
        "noEmitOnError": true,
        "strict": true,
        "noUnusedLocals": true,
        "pretty": true,
        "removeComments": true
    },
    "exclude": [
        "node_modules",
        "dist"
    ]
}
```

### PACKAGE.JSON

I add a script to `package.json` to run `tsc` for me.

```json
{
    //...
    "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc"
    },
    //...
}
```

## Install

Install Dynamic Config:

```sh
$ npm install --save @creditkarma/dynamic-config
```

We need to install a few other goodies. In the example we are going to use TypeScript.

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev typescript
$ npm install --save express
$ npm install --save @types/express
```

## Create the Default Config

A default config file is required. If you're doing something simple this may be enough. I'm going to create a new directory at my project root called `config`. Inside of this directory I'm going to create one file `default.json`.

```json
{
    "server": {
        "port": 8000,
        "host": "localhost"
    },
    "health": {
        "path": "control",
        "response": "success"
    }
}
```

## Create an Express Server

I'm going to create one more directory called `src` and in this directory I will add one file `index.ts`.

```typescript
import { config } from '@creditkarma/dynamic-config'
import * as express from 'express'

interface HealthCheckConfig {
    path: string
    response: string
}

(async function startServer() {
    const port: number = await config().get('server.port')
    const healthCheck: HealthCheckConfig = await config().get('health')
    const app: express.Application = express()

    app.get(`/${healthCheck.path}`, (req, res) => {
        res.send(healthCheck.response)
    })

    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Express server listening on port: ${port}`)
    })
}())
```

That's all we need for the most basic usage of Dynamic Config.

## Running Our Application

Compile TypeScript and run the app:

```sh
$ npm run build
$ node dist/index.js
```

Now you should be able to `curl` the running server:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8000/control
```

If all is well this should return "success" as defined in our `config/default.json` file.

## Environment Overrides

One of the main reasons to use a configuration library is to add a layer of abstraction for dealing with environment-specific configuration.

Environmnet-specific configuration files have the same name as the environment they configure. We are going to create a new file for the `development` environment. That means our file must be named "development". Just because we can, instead of `json` we are going to use a `js` file to hold our `development` configuration.

Create a new file called `development.js` in our `config` directory.

```js
module.exports.server = {
    port: 8080
}
```

Now we can run our server in the `development` environment with overrides.

```sh
$ NODE_ENV=development node dist/index.js
```

Now instead of port `8000` we are going to send a request of `8080`.

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8080/control
```

## Remote Configuration

Things get a little more complex when we talk about pulling in remote configuration and merging it with our local configuration in a seamless way. Dynamic Config supports a plugin API for adding support for remote configuration stores. For this next bit we are going to use Consul running in a Docker container to serve as our remote configuration source.

### Setting Up Consul with Docker

I am going to use `docker-compose` to configure and run my Consul container. If you don't have `docker` installed locally, you can check out install instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

I add a new file at my project root `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
version: '2'
services:
  consul:
    image: consul:latest
    volumes:
      - $PWD/consuldata:/tmp/consuldata
    ports:
      - "8410:8400"
      - "8510:8500"
      - "8610:8600"
    environment:
      - "CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG={\"disable_update_check\": true}"
      - "CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE=eth0"
    command: "consul agent -dev -client 0.0.0.0 -server -data-dir=/tmp/consuldata -bootstrap-expect=1"
```

Once we have this open a new terminal window and start Consul by typing:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

You will see some logging and very soon:

```sh
consul_1  | ==> Consul agent running!
```

Now we're ready to add some values to our Consul data store. There is an HTTP API for adding values to Consul, but for our purposes we are going to use the UI. The Consul UI can be found at `http://localhost:8510/ui/`.

You should see something like this:

![](./images/ui_homescreen.png)

Click on the tab `KEY/VALUE`:

![](./images/key_value.png)

This will work like our `development` override. We are going to add a JSON structure that will overlay our local config values. In the top text input we will add the key name `consul-config`. In the larger text box we include a blob of valid JSON (You will notice the built-in JSON validator).

```json
{
    "health": {
        "path": "status",
        "response": "GOOD"
    }
}
```

![](./images/create_key.png)

Click `CREATE` and we are ready to go.

### Configuring Our Application to Use Consul

In order for Dynamic Config to know about the values we added to Consul we must configure it to know about Consul. We can do this in a few ways. We can add static config in a file called `config-settings.json` at our project root, we can set configuration on environment variables or we can pass in command line arguments to our application. We are going to use command line arguments.

```sh
$ node ./dist/index.js CONSUL_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8510 CONSUL_DC=dc1 CONSUL_KEYS=consul-config
```

The three options we set are:
* `CONSUL_ADDRESS` - (required) This is the URL on which Consul is running
* `CONSUL_DC` - (required) The Consul data center for the key/value store.
* `CONSUL_KEYS` - (optional) These are keys in Consul that contain configs to overlay with our local configs. This can be a comma-separate list of multiple keys. You will notice I add the key we just created in Consul.

There is a fourth option we're not using:
* `CONSUL_NAMESPACE` - (optional) A string to prepend to all Consul look ups. If keys for your service are namespaced under `service-name` you could set this to your service name and then just use the unique key names when loading values, `service-name/<key>`.

Now when we `curl` our running application we can not longer hit `/control` as we have overriden the path in Consul to `/status`.

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8080/status
```

The response now should be `GOOD`.

### Using Remote Configuration for a Single Value

In addition to straight overlays of JSON objects, Dynamic Config also supports the notion of a placeholder in your config. Say you have a local config file for production, `production.json`, there is a value(s) that will be set on a per-data-center basis via Consul. For nothing more than arbitrary reasons let's say that such a value is the `port` on which the server will run.

I add a new file `production.json` to `config`:

```json
{
    "server": {
        "port": {
            "_source": "consul",
            "_key": "server-port",
            "_default": 8080,
            "_type": "number"
        }
    }
}
```

Okay, so we know `port` should be a number, but it is going to be set per host via Consul. We call that out by replacing the port number in our config with this placeholder object. When the library finds one of these objects it tries to resolve the value with the remote named by `_source`, `consul` is one of the remotes included by default. The `_key` property is a string which we search the remote for. The `_default` property is optional and provides a value to use in the event one cannot be retrieved from the remote. The `_type` property is also optional and is used to try to validate the value returned from the remote.

Back over to our Consul UI `http://localhost:8510/ui/`. We are going to add the key `server-port`. I set this value to `8090`.

![](./images/server_port.png)

Now, we have a new production config that points to a single value in Consul. Let's try this out. We will need to set `NODE_ENV=production` so we pick up the new local config file.

```sh
$ NODE_ENV=production node ./dist/index.js CONSUL_DC=dc1 CONSUL_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8510 CONSUL_KEYS=consul-config
```

And then test our work with `curl`:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8090/status
```

### Resolution Chain

At this point our config resolution chain is doing quite a lot.

1. Load `default.json` and create the initial configuration object.
2. Load `production.json` and overlay values in the current configuration.
3. Load the key `consul-config` from Consul and overlay values in the current configuration.
4. Recognize the placeholder for `port`, load the key `server-port` from Consul and replace the value in configuration.

This shows us one working flow, but how do we add additional remotes? How do we read envirnoment variables? How do we add file support? Wait, what is even the full API? Go back to the [README](../README.md) and continue through the documentation.
